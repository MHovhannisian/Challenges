## Matching Challenge

An important task for our work is to link records from different sources. Such matched or linked records can be very valuable as they provide a solid labelled data set, which can be used for predictive modelling purposes. Your task is to write a matching routine, which links ids (id2) in the matching file (`DatasetToMatch.csv`) to the ids (id1) in the core data set (`DatasetCore.csv`). In order to establish these links you can use any personal and contact information present in the files.

## Modelling Challenge

We have purchased a large record of consumer data for the 2,000,000 customers provided by ACME, and an additional 500,000 records for potential future targets. These include various demographic details and also a selection of proprietary Consumer Expenditure models for each consumer.


## Scala Challenge

A client has provided us with a copy of their membership database. Your task is to write a small [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) pipeline to ingest the data and run some basic queries to get an initial feel.

The data will eventually be used to reference a series of commercial features from another data set via the vendor_id.
